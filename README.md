# towatch
A simple program to manage a to-watch list for youtube videos.

DEPENDENCIES: dmenu, mpv, xclip

TODO: replace the case statement with getopt;
      Think about making a list with 10+ entries;
      optimize;
      add an option to let the the user choose a location for .towatch;
      maybe add a separate option for comment;
      think of a way to avoid dmenu (it's convenient though when you call
      the program with a keybinding).
